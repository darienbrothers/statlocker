# Navigation Streamlining - Athlete-First UX

## Overview
Successfully streamlined the StatLocker v1 app navigation by removing the onboarding sliders and implementing a direct Splash â†’ Welcome flow for a leaner, athlete-first user experience.

## Changes Made

### Navigation Flow Simplified
**Before**: `index.tsx` â†’ `splash.tsx` â†’ `(onboarding)/slides.tsx` â†’ `welcome.tsx`
**After**: `index.tsx` â†’ `splash.tsx` â†’ `welcome.tsx`

### Files Modified

#### âœ… `/app/splash.tsx`
- **Updated navigation target**: Changed from `router.replace('/(onboarding)/slides')` to `router.replace('/welcome')`
- **Fixed typography reference**: Updated `TYPOGRAPHY_TOKENS.bodyLarge` to `TYPOGRAPHY_TOKENS.body`
- **Maintained timing**: Kept 3-second animation duration before navigation

#### âœ… `/app/(onboarding)/_layout.tsx`
- **Removed slides screen**: Deleted `<Stack.Screen name="slides" />` from the navigation stack
- **Maintained other screens**: Kept welcome, basic-info, team, goals, review screens intact

### Files Removed

#### âœ… `/app/(onboarding)/slides.tsx`
- Removed wrapper component that imported OnboardingSliders
- No longer needed in streamlined flow

#### âœ… `/features/onboarding/screens/OnboardingSlider.tsx`
- Removed entire onboarding slider component with 4 slides:
  - "Track Every Stat" 
  - "AI Insights"
  - "Stay Organized" 
  - "Crush Your Goals"
- Eliminated complex slide navigation and animations

## Current Navigation Structure

### App Entry Points
```
index.tsx (Redirect to /splash)
â”œâ”€â”€ splash.tsx (3s animation â†’ /welcome)
â””â”€â”€ welcome.tsx (Start onboarding flow)
    â””â”€â”€ (onboarding)/
        â”œâ”€â”€ basic-info.tsx
        â”œâ”€â”€ team.tsx  
        â”œâ”€â”€ goals.tsx
        â””â”€â”€ review.tsx
```

### Onboarding Flow
1. **Splash Screen** (3 seconds)
   - Logo animation
   - "Track faster. Improve smarter." tagline
   - Auto-navigates to Welcome

2. **Welcome Screen** (Entry point)
   - Hero image and branding
   - "Get Started" CTA button
   - Sign-in option
   - Leads to basic-info onboarding

3. **Core Onboarding** (Unchanged)
   - Basic Info â†’ Team â†’ Goals â†’ Review
   - Maintains existing user data collection

## Benefits of Streamlining

## User Experience Impact

### Before (5 screens)
1. Splash (3s) â†’ 2. Slides (4 screens) â†’ 3. Welcome â†’ 4. Basic Info...

### After (3 screens)  
1. Splash (3s) â†’ 2. Welcome â†’ 3. Basic Info...

**Result**: 40% reduction in pre-onboarding screens, faster path to value
